# Sukhumvit font

Sukhumvit font is a Thai-made font, and I like it a lot. Therefore, I would like to request permission to save it in my own GitHub repository for easy access and use in my work. If there are any issues, please feel free to contact me directly [@xobazjr](https://www.facebook.com/XobazJr/).
